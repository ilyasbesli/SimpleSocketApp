Having a Player object that can send and receive messages

The use case for this task is as bellow:

1. create 2 players

2. one of the players should send a message to second player (let's call this player "initiator")

3. when a player receives a message should send back a new message that contains the received message concatenated with the message counter that this player sent.

4. finalize the program (gracefully) after the initiator sent 10 messages and received back 10 messages (stop condition)

5. both players should run in the same java process

6. document for every class the responsibilities it has.

7. additional challenge: have every player in a separate JAVA process

Please use pure Java as much as possible.
Please deliver a maven project with the source code so the jar can be build.
Please provide a shell script to start the program.
Everything what is not clearly specified is to be decided by developer.
